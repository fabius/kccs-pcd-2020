	abstract = {Plagiarism detection systems are essential tools for safeguarding academic and educational integrity. However, today's systems require disclosing the full content of the input documents and the document collection to which the input documents are compared. Moreover, the systems are centralized and under the control of individual, typically commercial providers. This situation raises procedural and legal concerns regarding the confidentiality of sensitive data, which can limit or prohibit the use of plagiarism detection services. To eliminate these weaknesses of current systems, we seek to devise a plagiarism detection approach that does not require a centralized provider nor exposing any content as cleartext. This paper presents the initial results of our research. Specifically, we employ Private Set Intersection to devise a content-protecting variant of the citation-based similarity measure Bibliographic Coupling implemented in our plagiarism detection system HyPlag. Our evaluation shows that the content-protecting method achieves the same detection effectiveness as the original method while making common attacks to disclose the protected content practically infeasible. Our future work will extend this successful proof-of-concept by devising plagiarism detection methods that can analyze the entire content of documents without disclosing it as cleartext.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the Diffie-Hellman protocol is to enable two users to exchange a secret key securely that can then be used for subsequent encryption of messages. The protocol itself is limited to exchange of the keys. But because of having no entity authentication mechanism, Diffie-Hellman protocol is easily attacked by the man-in-the-middle attack and impersonation attack in practice. In this paper, we compare the computational efficiency of various authentication methods. Finally an improved key exchange schema based on hash function is given, which improves the security and practicality of Diffie-Hellman protocol.},
